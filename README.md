**Action**

ðŸŸ¢Used Excelâ€™s PMT() function to calculate EMI based on loan amount, annual interest rate, and loan tenure.

ðŸŸ¢Derived total cost and total interest using formulae:

ðŸŸ¢Total Cost = EMI Ã— Tenure in months

ðŸŸ¢Total Interest = Total Cost âˆ’ Loan Amount

ðŸŸ¢Created a summarized comparative table and dashboard to visualize and interpret the data effectively.
